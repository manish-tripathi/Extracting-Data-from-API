- **Bachelor of Mathematics** degree from [St. Xavier's College, Mumbai](https://xaviers.edu/).

## My Passion

While my education and work history are important, my true enthusiasm lies in acquiring new skills and exploring emerging technologies, particularly in the realm of natural language processing and machine learning. I have undertaken numerous online courses and earned certifications in these areas. Additionally, I derive immense pleasure from delving into technical literature and articles on these subjects. You can explore some of my published works on my [personal website](https://manish-tripathi.github.io/Projects/) or my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maneeshtripathi/).

# My Projects

## [Project 1: Python Customer Segmentation & Clustering](https://nbviewer.org/github/manish-tripathi/Projects/blob/main/Python%20Customer%20Segmentation%20%26%20Clustering.ipynb)

In this project, I employed K-Means Clustering and Agglomerative Clustering techniques to segment customer data based on their Annual Income and Spending Score. [Explore the dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gaelim/Mall-Customer-Segmentation/main/Mall_Customers.csv).

## [Project 2: Extracting Data from API](https://nbviewer.org/github/manish-tripathi/Projects/blob/main/NewsApi_Manish_Tripathi.ipynb)

This project revolves around fetching news using APIs from [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/).

## [Project 3: Scraping Naukri.com for Information Technology Jobs in Hyderabad](https://nbviewer.org/github/manish-tripathi/Projects/blob/main/Naukri_Webscraper.ipynb)

Gathering primary data for data science projects can be costly and time-consuming. This project aims to identify companies in Hyderabad that are hiring for Information Technology roles and the skills they require. I accomplished this by scraping [Naukri.com](https://www.naukri.com/information-technology-jobs-in-hyderabad-secunderabad). You can find the resulting dataset [here](https://github.com/manish-tripathi/Projects/blob/main/Hyderabad_Information_Technology_Jobs.csv).

## [Project 4: Classifying Water Safety with XGBoost](https://nbviewer.org/github/manish-tripathi/Projects/blob/main/classifying-unbalanced-dataset-using-xgboost.ipynb)

This project deals with classifying whether water is safe for drinking using the powerful XGBoost classifier. The dataset contains information about various ingredients in water, and the goal is to predict water safety. [Learn more](https://machinehack.com/bootcamp/bootcampcourse/623c3b39473fe2338d71edad).

## [Project 5: Natural Language Processing Using Hugging Face Library](https://nbviewer.org/github/manish-tripathi/Projects/blob/main/nlp-using-hugging-face-library.ipynb)

Embark on a journey of learning Natural Language Processing with ease. I explored Natural Language Processing with Transformers, a technology that simplifies complex tasks such as sentiment analysis, translation, and more with just a single line of code. To dive deeper into this field, check out the book [Natural Language Processing with Transformers](https://www.amazon.in/Natural-Language-Processing-Transformers-Applications/dp/9355421877/ref=asc_df_9355421877/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=586323570422&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=7312920761120531252&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1007819&hvtargid=pla-1637749518926&psc=1). The code for the book is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nlp-with-transformers/notebooks).

## [Project 6: Creating Custom Datasets from Wikipedia with Python](https://nbviewer.org/github/manish-tripathi/Projects/blob/main/create-custom-datasets-from-wikipedia-with-python.ipynb)

Data is the foundation of any data science project. In this notebook, I demonstrate how to create custom datasets from Wikipedia using Python and Pandas, utilizing the `read_html` function. You can also watch a video tutorial on this topic by [Rob Mulla, Kaggle Grandmaster](https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube), available on his [YouTube Channel](https://youtu.be/KokJHxiE14s).

## [Project 7: Scraping Euronext for IPOs](https://nbviewer.org/github/manish-tripathi/Amplify-Analytix-Task/blob/main/scrapping-euronext-for-ipos.ipynb)

This project involves writing a Python script to scrape IPO listing data from Euronext's IPO Showcase page. The script automatically navigates through multiple pages to collect data on IPO dates, company names, and links to individual IPO details. This data is then structured into a Pandas DataFrame for easier analysis and manipulation.
