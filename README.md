# [Project 2: Extracting Data from API](https://github.com/manish-tripathi/Projects/blob/main/NewsApi_Manish_Tripathi.ipynb)
The Objective of the project is to fetch News using API from https://newsapi.org/

# [Project 3: Scrapping Naukri.com for Information Technology Jobs posted in Hyderabad](https://github.com/manish-tripathi/Projects/blob/main/Hyderabad_Manish_Tripathi.ipynb)
The first step in any data science job is to get Data. Collecting Primary data from respondants is costly and time consuming. One of the ways we can collecta dat is through scrapping it from the internet. The aim of this project is to identify key companies hiring for Information Technology Roles in Hyderabad and identify the skills they are looking for. For the project, have scrapped [Naukri.com](https://www.naukri.com/information-technology-jobs-in-hyderabad-secunderabad) for collecting the data.\

# [Project 4: Classifying if Water is Safe for Drinking using XGBoost](https://github.com/manish-tripathi/Projects/blob/main/classifying-unbalanced-dataset-using-xgboost.ipynb)
There are multiple scenarios where we need to identify the category of a given dataset; for example:

Classifying emails as spam or not
Classify a given handwritten character to be either a known character or not
Classify recent user behaviour as churn or not

XGBoost is considered to be one of the most powerful models for classification. Weâ€™ll see how it can be applied to classification problems. In this implementation, we are going to apply the XGBoost classifier to address the binary classification problem where our task is to predict whether water is safe for drinking or not.

The dataset holds information about the level of various ingredients present in water such as copper, lead, mercury, etc and there are such 20 features.

In binary features or the target feature, 0 states that the water is safe for drinking, and 1 states that it is not safe for drinking. So by making use of these features we are going to build an XGBoost classifier that will fit the relationship between those 20 features and the target feature.
